## Getting started

1. Fork and Clone
2. `cd` into the repo directory

# Ruby Practice

### Setup

First run `bundle install` (or `bundle` for short) in this directory.  This will install everything in our `Gemfile`.  (In this case it's just `rspec`)

### Practice time!

To run the specs, just `rspec`.  Or you can run `rspec --fail-fast` if you prefer for tests to stop after the first failure.

At first everything will fail.  Open up `methods.rb` and make em pass!

## Bonus

Want more practice?

Define some of the [underscorejs.org](http://underscorejs.org) methods in Ruby!  Specifically, define some [`Hash` methods](http://underscorejs.org/#objects) and [`Array` methods](http://underscorejs.org/#arrays)

Doing this is both fun and really good practice. Try these any time you're learning a new language.
